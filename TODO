Why do we get the rectangle  twice in plot.pdf in  ReadPDF/inst/samples/

Fix the coalesce() routine and the fixFnt and <span/>. 
   For now it is disabled.
   We seem to be adding span elements even when the font isn't changing - it is being set, but still the same.

Fix all the fontspecs in the XML that are the same.


Info about Images
  Get the correct x, y, width and height for PDF images.
    width and height seem to be the issue.
  [Done now] Not recognizing the PDF image in map.pdf.  What is the op in the PDF processing.
          This is a Do operation.  And a form (pointing to Im1 which resolves to 17 0 obj)

  are the x, y, width, height correct?  Compare with pdfminer?
  width height position.
  Format
  [yes] can we get the name of the original file if it is available.
     And meta data for the file.

  Dashes on lines.

  fill and line colors

  out device is notified of a change to colors with updateStrokeColor(), updateFillColor().
  Doesn't say which type of color it is. 
    The GfxColorSpace has a getMode() and this tells us what it is. We can even get the name.
    But with the plot.pdf which has an /sRGB

  Stroke versus fill

  

  

--------------------

[done] Add the rotation to each <page>.

[done] insert info. about links
  HmtmlOutputDev::drawLink() while processing a page.
  Calls pages->AddLink(t). So in the page.

[done] For the paths, do we need to deal with the current transformation
  Did we do this?  location, scaling.

  In KimShauman/inst/SampleCVs/CVTsoukiasweb_pdftohtml.xml, the <rect>
  has values that are 538, 5794, 4563, 5819 - so in the thousands for a
  page width and height 918 and 1188
