SegFault   clearGList()
 These seem to be figures that generate lots of paths/coords.
 And I probably am not dealing with the memory management properly.
 HtmlOutputDev.cc:1004 - two routines we instantiate. Called @1037 in HtmlPage::clear()
  eg. ~/DSIProjects/Zoonotics/NewData_Feb2017/Zoo_02_02_2017 Copy.Data/PDF/3704354175/
  Also producing 200 Mb from a small pdf.

  also huge XML file.

  doRadialShFill is common to both.

[done] Add flag to turn off output of paths.  -paths

[done] Add flag to turn off output of images.  -images
  

Have the coalesce respect changes in fonts, colors, etc.!

Why do we get the rectangle  twice in plot.pdf in  ReadPDF/inst/samples/

Fix the coalesce() routine and the fixFnt and <span/>. 
   For now it is disabled.
   We seem to be adding span elements even when the font isn't changing - it is being set, but still the same.

[check] Fix all the fontspecs in the XML that are the same.
  There is extra information about italic, bold, oblique,  that we weren't emitting and so they may well have been unique.

Info about Images
  Get the correct x, y, width and height for PDF images.
    width and height seem to be the issue.
  [Done now] Not recognizing the PDF image in map.pdf.  What is the op in the PDF processing.
          This is a Do operation.  And a form (pointing to Im1 which resolves to 17 0 obj)

  are the x, y, width, height correct?  Compare with pdfminer?
  width height position.
  Format
  [yes] can we get the name of the original file if it is available.
     And meta data for the file.

   Memory management.


In sample.pdf created by R, we are getting text elements with a value of q.
   Can we do better?


[check] Get colors and line width, styles, etc of rectangles, lines etc.

  Dashes on lines.

  fill and line colors

  out device is notified of a change to colors with updateStrokeColor(), updateFillColor().
  Doesn't say which type of color it is. 
    The GfxColorSpace has a getMode() and this tells us what it is. We can even get the name.
    But with the plot.pdf which has an /sRGB

  Stroke versus fill

  

  

--------------------

[done] Add the rotation to each <page>.

[done] insert info. about links
  HmtmlOutputDev::drawLink() while processing a page.
  Calls pages->AddLink(t). So in the page.

[done] For the paths, do we need to deal with the current transformation
  Did we do this?  location, scaling.

  In KimShauman/inst/SampleCVs/CVTsoukiasweb_pdftohtml.xml, the <rect>
  has values that are 538, 5794, 4563, 5819 - so in the thousands for a
  page width and height 918 and 1188
