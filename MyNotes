The CTM is set in GfxState::GfxState initially and is [1.5 0, 0 -1.5]
based on the dimensions of the page in DPI/72.

Rotation - see computeRotation.
 Works for examples/rotate.pdf
[Check fix] Not working for Zoonotics
  Look at the text matrix:

Check examples/keynote.key.pdf and examples/img.pdf 
??? img.pdf seems odd - pages 3 and 4???

+ [done] Rotated images?
  Added to output if rotated.

+ [Done] Scaling of images?
 PDF reference, p351 :"but since all images are defined on the unit square in user space,.."
  This suggests that getting the a and d in the CTM is appropriate for the drawn dimensions
  as the image will be scaled to these.

+ [Fixed] Doesn't produce any <img> elements: 0325259182/Rowan-1957-Relationship between Some Coastal F.pdf
 Note that it is an ImageMask. That was the issue.


+ Now outputting both the original height and width as well as the CTM scale values
i.e. the CTM[1,1] and CTM[2,2] elements and assuming these are the dimensions of the drawn images
Seems to work for, e.g.,
  0588333063/de\ Souza\ Lopes-1981-Emergence\ of\ a\ new\ arbovir.pdf 

In keynote.key.pdf, the first page image - regular size of 500 x 720
  311 0 0 419.9129 156 186.0436 cm /Im1 Do
And the second shrunk image is
  187 0 0 252.549 186 173.0153 cm /Im1 Do

When we move the second one to the top-left corner of the slide
 187 0 0 252.549 7 335.3682 cm /Im1 Do Q
Note the last two 


How to get the contents of an image and write them to a file as a PNG, JPEG, etc.
i.e. their original format.
  Can handle JPG





How are the flags being set so that isItalic()  on a GfxFont returns true.


HtmlPage::addChar() was starting a new string when it encountered a space.
    Undone this.


We'd ideally like to emit the content as they are read from the PDF stream.
We don't do this because 1) pdftohtml wasn't setup this way, 2)  we may have 
to compute the locations for the text/characters ourselves, 3) we'd have to change
when the <page> ...  are emitted.  3) is related to 1) and not a big deal.
Because of 1) & 3), we have to collect the paths in  the the HtmlPage as they are
encountered and annouced with out->fill().  We copy the path and then emit
the XML for the subpaths.

The paths have little information. We can identify them as lines, rectangles, etc.
with an enum in the GfxPath so that we can emit the appropriate XML element easily.
Currently we check the coordinates of the path to see if it is a rectangle.





-----------




pdftothml  (see first stack trace)
  creates a PDFDoc.
     which reads the PDF and interprets it.
  calls doc-displayPages() 
     It passes is htmlOut  a HtmlOutputDev object.  See HtmlOutputDev.h
     This HtmlOutputDev has start and end page methods.


Then Page::display() is called and this leads to the HtmlOutputDev::endPage() call
And this calls HtmlPage::dump and this then calls its own dumpAsXML() method.

The HtmlPage::dumpAsXML (HtmlOutputDev.cc 641) writes the fonts and the text.
 What else does it have access to at this point. Look at the HtmlPage class in HtmlOutputDev.h
 It has an addChar() method.  Where is this called?
 Can we add a addRectangle()/curve/line method to this class - HtmlPage?

Where is addChar() called  (add a breakpoint and run)
See trace 2
  Gfx is calling doShowText().  Now out->useDrawChar() has to be true.
  Gfx has methods opLineTo{,1,2} and other curve and opRectangle methods.
    In opRectangle() it calls the state->moveTo(), state->lineTo()
      Note: We lose the "rectangle" aspect of this and would have to piece together the consecutive lines that are connected.
      The stat is the GFxState.
    Gfx.h has the OutputDev, but isn't calling it for opRectangle. But is in doShowText()
    Perhaps opClosePath() is the place.


The opStroke() method does call out->stroke
and doEndPath() calls out->clip() (or eoClip)
opBeginText() calls out-?updateTextMat/Pos().
opEndText() calls out->endTextObject()



When PDF sets e.g. line dash, line cap, line width etc.  out->update* is called.


The GFx holds the resources for the pages. But the graphical elements are coming by us as they are processed (?)

out->dump() called in the Gfx::go() method and that seems to be the interpreter.
in opFilllStroke()
   out->fill()
   out->stroke()






HtmlPage holds the text in yxStrings
  addChar() and endString()
  endString is called from Gfx::opShowText -> Gfx::doShowText() -> endString

HtmlOutputDevice::needNoText()  currently returns false.
  Changed now. Can create an extended class.
  However this only affects whether images are included or not.
  It is only used in Gfx.cc twice - once to skip pattern fill, and for Image in opXObject


The GfxState maintains "the state" of the graphics such as line cap, dash, 
 and also has methds for lineTo(), curveTo() and moveTo().

The Gfx has the out.



Are the rectangles, etc. stored in the GfxState and present when HtmlOutputDev::endPage() is called?
 If so, we can get them then from the state.
 Appears not!
